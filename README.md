# grubFX Home Assistant

- work in progress, changing stuff all the time
- screenshots can be slightly out of date

## DISCLAIMER
The files in `custom_components` and `www` are a collection from other repositories such as https://github.com/custom-cards and I do not take any credit or responsibility for them. They're also easily updatable by the `custom_updater` component via the UI which is why I like to have them under version control and therefore linked to the matching version of my configuration.

## // TODOs
- Configuration
  - fix `device_sun_light_trigger` component
- UI
  - try to integrate weather forecasts graphs
  - try out themes
